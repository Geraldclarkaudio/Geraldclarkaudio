- 👋 Hi, I’m @Geraldclarkaudio
- 👀 I’m interested in all things Game Development, but I mostly dabble in game audio. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to program my own games so I can be more valuable to a team, and be able to trouble shoot. 
- 💞️ I’m always willing to collaborate with others to learn and to teach.
- 📫 How to reach me: Feel free to email me at geraldclarkaudio@gmail.com
